    "I'm aware some of this is backwards in the order I learn them daily.I keep notes here as well as in notion so I've noticed in my notion databse which is organized top to bottom in terms on the order I would normally learn these things how backwards this is. It's because I've been adjusting my learning tools and sticking with catching up with the tools I'm currently using. (py4e)[py4e.com] is a great learning resource but it doesn't give me as much information as I think I need. I have gone outside of it to supplement my learning many times now so I decided to read a dedicated book about python as well as reading the docs which has been tremendously helpful in pointing out gaps in that knowledge. Anyways I expect much of today to be about putting in practice what I learned about modules so that's the reason for the world salad. "
